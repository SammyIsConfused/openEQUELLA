<xml><item year="1974">><description>The Intel 8080 (&quot;eighty-eighty&quot;) is the second 8-bit microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel. It first appeared in April 1974 and is an extended and enhanced variant of the earlier 8008 design, although without binary compatibility.[2] The initial specified clock rate or frequency limit was 2 MHz, and with common instructions using 4, 5, 7, 10, or 11 cycles this meant that it operated at a typical speed of a few hundred thousand instructions per second. A faster variant 8080A-1 (Sometimes called the 8080B) became available later with clock frequency limit up to 3.125 MHz. </description><category name="cisc"><sub-category name="8"/></category><name>Intel 8080</name><attachment>a6a711ee-e212-46ab-9b14-01c8ca978315</attachment><keywords><keyword>intel</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>z80</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>nmos</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>x86</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
