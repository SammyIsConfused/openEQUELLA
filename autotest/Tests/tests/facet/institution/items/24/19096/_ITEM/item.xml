<xml><item year="2001"><description>Itanium (/a&#x026a;&#x02c8;te&#x026a;ni&#x0259;m/ eye-TAY-nee-&#x0259;m) is a family of 64-bit Intel microprocessors that implement the Intel Itanium architecture (formerly called IA-64). Intel marketed the processors for enterprise servers and high-performance computing systems. The Itanium architecture originated at Hewlett-Packard (HP), and was later jointly developed by HP and Intel.

Itanium-based systems have been produced by HP (the HP Integrity Servers line) and several other manufacturers. In 2008, Itanium was the fourth-most deployed microprocessor architecture for enterprise-class systems, behind x86-64, Power ISA, and SPARC.[2][needs update]

In February 2017, Intel released the final generation, Kittson, to test customers, and in May began shipping in volume.[3][4] It is used exclusively in mission-critical servers from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

  Intel officially announced the discontinuation of the Itanium CPU family on January 30, 2019.[1] </description><category name="epic"><sub-category name="64"/></category><name>Itanium</name><attachment>e394bb12-ab89-4156-91aa-612b5d3b5ba5</attachment><keywords><keyword>intel</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>IA-64</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
