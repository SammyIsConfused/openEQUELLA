<xml><item year="1978"> <description>The 8086[2] (also called iAPX 86)[3] is a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel between early 1976 and June 8, 1978, when it was released. The Intel 8088, released July 1, 1979,[4] is a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus (allowing the use of cheaper and fewer supporting ICs),[note 1] and is notable as the processor used in the original IBM PC design.

  The 8086 gave rise to the x86 architecture, which eventually became Intel's most successful line of processors. On June 5, 2018, Intel released a limited-edition CPU celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Intel 8086, called the Intel Core i7-8086K.[4]</description><category name="cisc"><sub-category name="16"/></category><name>Intel 8086</name><attachment>2e499bc0-8570-45b4-9b6c-cfea1ffcc959</attachment><keywords><keyword>intel</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>x86</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
