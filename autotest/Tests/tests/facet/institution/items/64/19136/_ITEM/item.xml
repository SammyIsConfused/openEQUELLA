<xml><item year="2007"><description>Clojure (/&#x02c8;klo&#x028a;&#x0292;&#x0259;r/, like closure)[15][16] is a modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform.[17][18] Like other Lisp dialects, Clojure treats code as data and has a Lisp macro system.[19] The current development process is community-driven,[20] overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).[21]

Clojure advocates immutability and immutable data structures and encourages programmers to be explicit about managing identity and its states.[22] This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs is intended to facilitate developing more robust, especially concurrent, programs that are simple and fast.[23][24][15] While its type system is entirely dynamic, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of gradual typing.[25]
  Commercial support for Clojure is provided by Cognitect.[26] Clojure conferences are organized every year across the globe, the most famous of them being Clojure/conj.[27] </description><category name="functional"><sub-category name="dynamic"/></category><name>Clojure</name><attachment>442c4c0d-ee4c-4ca0-90a3-e71c2dcb9f7a</attachment><keywords><keyword>jvm</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>lisp</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>multi-paradigm</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
