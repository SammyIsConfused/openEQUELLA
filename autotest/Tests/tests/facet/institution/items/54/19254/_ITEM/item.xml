<xml><item year="2010"><description>Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.[16][17] Rust is syntactically similar to C++,[18] and provides memory safety without using garbage collection.

Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others.[19][20] The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine,[21] and the Rust compiler. The compiler is free and open-source software dual-licensed under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0. It has gained increasing use in industry and is now Microsoft's language of choice for secure and safety-critical software components.[22] [23]

  Rust has been the &quot;most loved programming language&quot; in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.</description><category name="functional"><sub-category name="static"/></category><name>Rust</name><attachment>396dce8b-543b-41b8-8f8a-d3beb1fc3981</attachment><keywords><keyword>concurrent</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>multi-paradigm</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>draft</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
