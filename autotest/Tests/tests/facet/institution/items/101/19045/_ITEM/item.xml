<xml><item year="1987"><description>SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) is a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) originally developed by Sun Microsystems.[1][2] Its design was strongly influenced by the experimental Berkeley RISC system developed in the early 1980s. First developed in 1986 and released in 1987,[3][2] SPARC was one of the most successful early commercial RISC systems, and its success led to the introduction of similar RISC designs from a number of vendors through the 1980s and 90s. </description><category name="risc"><sub-category name="64"/></category><name>SPARC</name><attachment>f9e7fb19-7caf-4d36-a38d-100acdb4f62c</attachment><keywords><keyword>sun</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>oracle</keyword></keywords><keywords><keyword>Register-Register</keyword></keywords></item></xml>
